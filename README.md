# SOC-Intro-to-Machine-Intelligence
Introduction to Machine Intelligence started with a meeting discussing the tentative schedule and the resources to be used throughout the course. <br />
# Week-1
The first week was based on an introduction to Python and how to use Jupyter. This began with an introduction to Anaconda using the available resources https://neighborly-clover-184.notion.site/Resources-0d409b1d58664e06a60c91395c762afc with which we set up Anaconda. Other options available were Google Collab and Python, but it was preferred because Anaconda had better UI and many inbuilt applications. <br />
The above-mentioned site also contains the Basics of Python, exception handling, an introduction to classes, and Python standard libraries. <br />
For practicing my hold on Python, I practiced it on coding websites like CodeChef and HackerRank.
The certificate I received for Basics of Python is attached below-<br />

# Week-2
This week was based on learning the basics of NumPy, Git, and GitHub, and Introduction to Neural Networks. <br />
Basics of NumPy operations was learned using the PyCK resource available on YouTube(link- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93uKo-F9SSo). This lecture consisted of Numpy Basics, Multi-dimensional NumPy arrays, and NumPy libraries. <br />
NumPy basics included Creating a NumPy array, practicing element-wise operations such as %timeit, list(), arrange(), dtype, ndim, shape, size, astype, etc. We also practised array operations such as np.matrix(), np.transpose(), np.dot(a,b), np.copy(x), np.arange() and more. <br />
Then we learned Broadcasting, I/O, Linear Algebra, String Manipulation and Statistics. <br />
To learn Git and GitHub fundamentals, we referred the following YouTube links- <br />

For Introduction to Neural Networks we referred the playlist created by DeepLearningAI– <br />

This playlist was set to be covered in week 2 and 3. <br />
Until now I have completed videos of the the following topics-<br />

•	What are Neural Networks (NN) <br />
•	Supervised Learning with NN <br />
•	Why Deep Learning <br />
•	Binary Classification on images <br />
•	Computational graph of NN<br />
•	NN Notations <br /> 
•	Shorthand idea of NN Computations <br />
I am a little lagging behind the schedule due to midsems but will try to coverup as soon as midsems are over.
